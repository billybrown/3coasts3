        <h1>About 3Coasts</h1>

<p>Beyond focusing on making websites and web applications that look great and work well, we’re committed to staying on the cutting edge of the web, which today is no small errand: the web, and how we use it, is constantly, even exponentially, expanding. We surf the crest of this wave and do it in style.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, we’re some of the most avid technology users there are. We consistently bring our own experiences— both the joys and frustrations of living and working in a profoundly wired world—back to the work we do every day. The nature of the web dictates that our work is never finished, but we prefer it that way. It’s the environment we thrive in. When you partner with us, the web will be where your organization thrives, too.</p>

<h2>Staff</h2>

<p><strong>Brian Berlin</strong></p>

<p><em>Owner / Lead Developer</em></p>

<p>Brian Berlin started working in technology straight out of college at BClip, a video production company he helped start with his brothers, where he was in charge of deliverables. Over time, his responsibilities expanded from creating multimedia CD-ROMs and trade show kiosks to developing websites for their clients. Over the past several years he has focused on developing sites using Drupal, the open source platform and community to which he regularly contributes. He is well studied in the benefits of using Drupal over other platforms. He is a top notch Javascript programmer and a Jquery ninja, has extensive experience with PHP, and is an accomplished graphic designer. He has, over time, attained a thorough insight into the needs and requirements of modern websites of all kinds, as well as what makes for a good website and good content. Because of his broad experience, he is capable of overseeing web projects of all types.</p>

<p></br></p>

<p><strong>Alec Quig</strong></p>

<p><em>Project Manager</em></p>

<p>Alec Quig is our project manager. He wears many hats, but most importantly, he communicates extremely well and keeps us efficient and organized. He acts as an interface between our clients and developers, makes sure everyone understands one another, and in so doing streamlines our entire process. He’s also an excellent wordsmith, and acts as our copywriter—he’s already worked as a writer, interviewer, and photographer for The Chicago Tribune’s Redeye, Metromix, BOMB Magazine in Brooklyn, NY, and The Portland Mercury. He can pitch in on design when needed, and is here to be at your disposal for whatever needed when everyone else on the team is head down, in the trenches, and writing code.</p>

<p></br></p>

<p><strong>Dan Horne</strong></p>

<p><em>Senior Developer</em></p>

<p>Dan Horne has been working with us in some capacity from the start, and in July he decided to team up with us full time from his home in Asheville. He was previously COO of TAIS, an ISP that serviced the downtown Asheville area. He has both broad and deep experience in all kinds of internet technologies, and after providing custom development for a variety of clients, he decided to leave his previous job to focus on web development. He is our Wordpress guru and has even contributed some plugins on that front.</p>
