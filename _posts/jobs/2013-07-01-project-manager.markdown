We've been landing new work left and right, and need a front-end developer to work with our lead developer, senior developer, and project manager to get projects moving out the door faster and better.

- Knowledge of CSS3 coding techniques: Media Queries, Animations, Transitions, etc.
- Experience with a version controlled workflow, specifically using GIT
- At least one example showcasing your use of a third-party API (Facebook, Twitter, Google Maps, Twilio, etc.)
