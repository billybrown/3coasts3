summary: A highly interactive, “sticky,” and fun-to-use site to stand out in a surprisingly competitive market.

---

[LuvUrLocker.com](http://www.luvurlocker.com/) sells a cornucopia of custom locker decorations to tweens. The lovely ladies who co-own the company left corporate careers behind to start the business, and as their daughters represent the company's core customer base, it inevitably became a family affair. All told, the site’s a healthy mix of valedictorian, football captain, and prom queen. Given its target audience, the company needed a highly interactive, “sticky,” and fun-to-use site to stand out in a surprisingly competitive market. We used Drupal Commerce to create an extremely flexible checkout framework for the site, which revolves around a customizable, interactive locker its clients can virtually personalize, decorate, perfect, and then order. There’s some serious brains and brawn behind the site’s flirty, zebra-striped exterior: LuvUrLocker’s owners can directly access the site’s content management system and add new products independently without the help (or cost) of developers, the site’s built-in commerce architecture allows the business owners to easily access sophisticated and filterable sales and tax reports, and direct integration with the LuvUrLocker credit card processor makes for a checkout process that’s seamless, intuitive, and fun.
