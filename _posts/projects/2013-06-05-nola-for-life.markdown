We worked with GMc+ Advertising and Spike Lee's advertising agency, SpikeDDB, to develop this site for NOLA for Life, a multimedia campaign to raise public awareness about local violence.

We worked with GMc+ Advertising and Spike Lee's advertising agency, SpikeDDB, to develop this site for NOLA for Life, a multimedia campaign to raise public awareness about local violence:

"The idea is that the frequent news reports that mark each death do little more than discourage, desensitize and distract from a critical truth: there’s so much more to the story. This campaign reveals what the community has been missing by taking the violence out of the headlines and showing the hope that remains. The aim is to inspire youths to change their thinking from defeated to emboldened and to work alongside them to flip the script on NOLA’s future."

The site features a wide variety of multimedia and also collects donations--every dollar donated by individuals is instantly matched. The site promotes jobs, volunteer positions, events, and serves as a central hub for the campaign both on and off the web.
