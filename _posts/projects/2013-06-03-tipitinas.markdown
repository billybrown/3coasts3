We’re very proud to have created the website for the crown jewel of New Orleans music venues, Tipitina’s. We spearheaded a major overhaul of the site’s previous incarnation, bringing a classic venue triumphantly into the 21st century. The focus is now on the venue’s extensive and ever-rotating calendar, which is completely customizable by the Tipitina’s staff. A focus on press photos both shows and tells what’s going on, and it’s integrated with an e-commerce system that makes buying tickets online a breeze. Social media, largely absent from their previous site, is also given a prominent role—their busy Twitter feed is hard to miss, and a variety of strategic links to Facebook, Spotify, and Pandora encourage visitors to engage with the rich culture and tradition Tip’s embodies. Because the venue is so regularly celebrated in the media, their staff can also add news stories to the site to their hearts’ content. So people far and wide can peruse the site whether on phones, tablets, or laptops, the site is fully responsive. All of this makes for a happy music venue, and hopefully, happy concert-goers!
